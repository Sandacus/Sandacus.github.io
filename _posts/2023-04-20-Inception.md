I have decided to strip back this website and start from scratch! And today is the day I have finally taken the first steps.

I have removed all the styling and javascript and will build it from the ground up. I have been thinking of doing this for a long time, however procrastination and wanting to have a perfect vision of what I'm aiming for have stopped me. I have realised that this is the wrong way to think! It is far better to start something imperfectly and iterate on that than never to start at all.

I intend to have a section act as a blog to help keep myself accountable in creating this website. Things I need to do;

* Plan the strucutre of the website *i.e.*, what content goes where.
* Apply a style/theme to the website so it doesn't look like ugly plain `html`.
* Link a scripts file where I can write any `javascript` I want or need.
