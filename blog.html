    <p><em>20 April 2023</em></p>
  <p>I have decided to strip back this website and start from scratch!
    And today is the day I a have finally taken the first steps.
  </p>
  <p>I have removed all the styling and javascript and will build it from the ground up.
    I have been thinking of doing this for a long time, 
    however procrastination and wanting to have a perfect vision of what I'm aiming for have stopped me.
    I have realised that this is the wrong way to think! It is far better to start something imperfectly 
    and iterate on that than never to start at all.
  </p>
  <p>I intend to have a section act as a mini blog to help keep myself accountable in creating this website.
  </p>
  <p>Things I need to do;
    <ul>
      <li>Plan the strucutre of the website <em>i.e.</em>, what content goes where.</li>
      <li>Apply a style/theme to the website so it doesn't look like ugly plain <code>html</code>.</li>
      <li>Link a scripts file where I can write any <code>javascript</code> I want or need.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><em>22 April 2023</em></p>
  <p>I have been been learning about templating engines for websites.
    The examples I have come across are;
    <ul>
      <li>EJS, a <code>javascript</code> based templating engine.</li>
      <li>Jekyll, a ruby based templating engine that is advertised for the github pages.</li>
      <li>Jinja, which a python based templating engine, used in the <code>flask</code> web framework.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I am making a basic to do list app with <code>Express</code> and <code>EJS</code> to practice the basics of 
  creating an app and using templating to generate <code>html</code>. </p>

  <p><em>24 April 2023</em></p>
  <p>I've createad a seperate file for this blog. One (small) step closer to building a beautiful, well-designed website!
    I think perhaps the next thing is to use <code>bootstrap</code> to make things look a little nicer.
